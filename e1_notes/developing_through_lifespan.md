## Prenatal and Childhood Development
* prenatal development
* infancy and childhood
  * physical development
  * cognitive development
  * social development
    * attachment
    * parenting styles

---
## Prenatal
* _TN_ -
  * development
    * _def_ -
      * change in org from conception to death
* zygote
  * rapid cell division
  * conception - 2w
    * _TN_ -
      * placenta and...
* embryo
  * some organ formation; heart beat
  * 2 - 8w
    * _TN_ -
      * sexual differentiation occurs _~7w_
* fetus
  * higher level organ formation
  * 9w to birth
    * _TN_ -
      * response to stimuli etc
      * _22~23w_ - said to have reached _age of viability_ -> when the child can live outside womb
        * dev. of lungs

---
## Prenatal (cont)
* teratogens
  * harmful substances entering placenta
  * smoking => low birth-weight
    * _TN_ -
      * different than prematurity
        * based on time
        * born earlier than 36w
      * low birth weight worse than prematurity
        * prem. -> more likely to catch up wrt dev.
        * lbw -> less likely to catch up wrt dev.
  * alcohol => fetal alcohol syndrome
    * (fetal alcohol disorder)
      * number 1 _known_ cause of what was called "mental ret*rdation"
        * now => "intellectually disabled"
    * specific appearance
      * misshapen facial features
    * challenging behavioral problems
      * discipline, attention

---
## Physical
* maturation
  * inborn genetic growth processes
  * occur in sequence
    * stages
* motor dev
  * neuromuscular maturation
  * walking/toileting
    * early on - not developed enough to receive messages about

---
## Cognitive
* _TN_ -
  * intelligence (in this context)
* Jean Piaget
  * _TN_ -
    * young thinkers to adults who can think hypothetically
      * simple -> complex
  * children reason diff than adults
  * intellectual progression
  * shaped by experiences
    * _TN_ -
      * nuture
  * interest in _wrong answers_
    * _TN_ -
      * why people get things wrong
      * same wrong answer at the ~same age
        * 8y chooses wrong answer, likely another 8y chooses same wrong answer

---
## Piaget (Cognit.)
* schemata
  * concepts that organize information
  * assimilation
    * new experience into current understanding
  * accommodation
    * adjusting and modifying schema
      * _TN_ -
        * may also create a new schema
        * if exp. did not fit into current world view
  * _TN_ -
    * as we get older
      * take new experience -> into current world view
        * (see assimilation)
* ex -> cars
  * _TN_ -
    * "what is a car"
      * wheels, doors, steering wheel, etc.
        * all same in some respects

---
## Piaget's Stages - know these
* sensorimotor (birth - almost 2y)
    * _TN_ -
      * respond to stimuli of environ.
  * sensory impressions and motor activities
  * object permanence -> can't experience, but know it's still there
  > **BUT**
  * current evidence that infants _do_ think
    * numerically impossible outcome
      * _TN_ -
        * something in front of cup
          * take away
            * 1 cup -> good
            * 3 cups -> confused???

---
## Piaget's Stages (cont)
* preoperational (2 - 6/7y)
  * represent things w/ words and images
    * _TN_ -
      * movements, things outside of them
        * represented by language
        * ex. waving hand = to go somewhere else
        * ex. McDonald's logo = yummy stuff
  * problems w/ conservation
    * _TN_ -
      * ex. tall skinny glass holds more liquid than shallow wide glass
        * taller = more
  * egocentrism
    * difficulty taking another's POV
      * physical or emotion
  * theory of mind
    * ability to understand other's mental states

---
## P's S's (cont)
* concrete operational (~6/7 - 11)
  * logical thinking about concrete events
  * grasp conservation/math transformation
    * _TN_ -
      * math transfromation - 4 + 2 = 2 + 4
        * learn this quicker - memorize times tables much quicker
* formal operational (~12 - adult)
  * abstract thinking
    * _TN_ -
      * consider consequences of actions, even long-term
  * _if-then_ thinking
    * consequences

---
## Comments on Piaget
* _TN_ -
  * got _what_ correct
    * _when_ incorrect/incomplete
* globally influential, but research suggests
  * development is more continuous
  * children express mental abilities earlier
  * formal logic as smaller part of cognition
    * _TN_ -
      * think w/ emotions

---
## Social Dev. and Attach
* attachment
  * emotional bond w/ another person/being
  * survival impulse
* (Harry) Harlow (1968)
  * _monkeys_ and attachment
    * _TN_ -
      * why attach with mother, not someone/thing else
  * body contact v. biological needs
    * _TN_ -
      * places physical comfort over need for food et al
  * fearful reactions and "open field tests"
    *

---
## (Mary) Ainsworth and Attachment
* strange situation
  * _TN_ -
    * unknown to child
  * series of separations/reunions
  * infant reactions to reunion with parent
* 3 attachment styles
  * anxious
    * avoidant
      * stay clear from fig. - prove point
      * _really_ upset
      * tantrums
      * screaming
    * resistant
      * don't calm as quickly
      * tantrum
      * _really_ upset
      * screaming
  * secure -> "best"
    * upset when fig. leaves; cries but no tantrum
    * want soothing from fig.

---
## Attachment Concerns
* lack of attachment
  * withdrawn
  * frightened
  * speech difficulties
    * _TN_ -
      * people learn language by exposure to language
      * choose to not be around people
        * don't benefit from exposure to language
* attachment and institutions
  * importance of adult responsiveness
    * orphanages
      * people check on them
    * current medical practice
      * stay overnight w/ early stages child
    * daycare
      * pick up children and play w/ them

---
## Parenting Styles
* related to parental control
* authoritarian
  * "because I said so"
  * emphasize rules/obedience/consequences
* permissive
  * want to be your friend, not your parent
  * lax
  * few demands/punishment
* authoritative -> in the middle
  * have rules, but not implemented w/o reason/discussion
  * demanding and responsive
