## What is Psych
* scientific sturyd of _behavior_ and _mental processes_
* not always humans
  * dogs (Pavlov)
  * rats (Skinner)
  * cats
  * pidgeons
* roots of psych
  * prescientific psych
  * birth/dev't of psych science
* contemporary
  * 3 levels of analysis
  * subfields

---
## Presci. Psych
* Confucius
  * power of ideas and educated mind
* Socrates and Plato
  * mind and body are separate
    * what goes on in head and what body does are independent of each other
  * mind exists after death
    * what goes on in mind will exist after death
  * knowledge is innate
    * you are as smart as you are going to be as soon as you are born
    * cannot improve knowledge
* product of env or parents?
  * _both_
  * (nature v nurture)

---
* Descartes
  * mind/body separate
    * still around, hasn't changed since S+P
    * they interact, but are still separate
  * _"animal spirits"_
    * vesicles that, when activated, causes a reaction -> to do things
      * cerebro-spinal fluid - does not actually cause reaction
    * had no phys ev to support
---
## Presci. Empiricism
* Bacon + Locke
  * Bacon
    * experimental method (origins of sci. meth.)
  * Locke
    * _"tabula rasa"_ -> "clean slate"
      * born => blank slate to become someone informed and determined based on personal experience
      * nature v nurture => nature wins
  * **Empricism** -> knowledge originates in experience and sci should rely on observ. and experimentation
    * Freud -> hypothesized about subjects' childhoods (_post hoc_)

---
## Structuralism v Functionalism
* Structuralism
  * started in Europe
  * elements of mind
    * pieces that fit together to form the mind
    * reaction times
      * ie, auditory threshold (started here)
  * introspection
    * inside info
  * Wilhelm Wundt (1879)
  * Edward Tichner
* Functionalism
  * American psych
  * how we use our minds
  * evolved funcs of thoughts/feelings
  * adaptive skills
  * William James
    * [Father of American Psych]
    * _Principles of Psychology_

---
## Contemp. Psych
3 main levels of analysis
* bio-psycho-socio psychology
* biological influences ->
  * nature
* psych'l influences ->
  * nurture
* socio-cultural influences ->
  * nurture-sub
  * interactions w/ other people

subfields - basic research (to build knowledge)

| Psychologist | What they do |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Bio | explores links b/w brain and mind |
| Dev | changing abilities from birth to death |
| Cog | percieve, think, solve problems |
| Person. | investigates persistent traits |
| social | explores how we view and affect each other |

---
applied research (invest. practical problems)

| Psychologist | What they do |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Indust./Org. (I/O) | study and advise on behavior in workplace |
| Counseling | help cope w/ academic, vocational, marital challenges |
| School | assess/treat academic/behavorial difficulties that affect students |
| Clinical | study, assess, treat people w/ psych. disorders |

* counseling, school, clinical - only fields licensed to treat for money

## Psych. and Crit. Thinking
* limits of intuition and common sense
  * common sense predictions proven **INCORRECT**
    * repression of traumatic experiences
    * dreams predict the future
      * random cog. behav. ind't of reality
    * absence does not make the heart grow fonder -> just find someone else
    * _vaccinations do not cause autism_
  * hindsight bias -> _"I knew it all along"_ phenomenon
    * stock market decline **after the fact**
    * tragedy of 9/11 **after the fact**
    * mass shootings?
  * overconfidence -> tendency to think we know more than we do
    * often persists even after proven _wrong_
      * _"I was almost right."_
      * so close to winning, but still lost
    * be open to how/why you were proven wrong
* sci. attitude
* sci. meth.

---
## [Remember](#remember)
* hindsight bias + overconfidence = _overestimates_ of intuition (of what we know)

---
## Sci. Attitude
* components of
  * curiosity
  * skepticism
  * humility -> understand being wrong and accept it
  * **crit thinking**
    * does not blindly accept args. and concl.
    * examines assumptions, discerns vals., evals. ev, assesses concls.
  * in relationships w/ people more alike than unalike
    * more likely to disbelieve people different than us

---
## Sci. Meth.
* theory -> principles that **organize and predict** behavs./events
  * ex. -> ADHD and observable behav.
* hypothesis -> testable prediction that allows acceptance, rejection, or revision of theory
* experimenation
  * operational definitions -> define variables in order to -> replicate
  * replication ->
    * [MMR Controversy of 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy)
      * co-authors asked to be disassociated w/ paper
    * [Embryo cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Woo-suk)
