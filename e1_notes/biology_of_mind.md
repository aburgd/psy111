## Introduction
* biopsychosocial system
* neurons
  * makeup
  * how they communicate
* nervous system
  * central
  * peripheral
* endocrine system
  * hormones
  * glands

---
## Neurons (makeup)
* cell body
* dendrites (listen -> receive messages)
* axon (speak -> send messages)
  * myelin sheath
    * axons w/ " send messages more quickly
    * fatty substance that insulates the axon
    * multiple sclerosis -> myelinated axons are degraded; messages are disjointed, or just don't send
  * terminal branches -> ends of axons; actually sends the messages

---
## Neurons (makeup (cont.))
* building blocks of the nervous system

---
## Neurons (action potential)
* _action potential_ (AP)
  * neural impulse -> brief electrical charge
  * moves from _cell body_ down _axon_ to _terminal branches_ to next cell's _dendrites_
    * only moves in **one direction**
* caused by:
  * signals from sensory receptors (touch, smell, thermo-, etc.)
  * (chemical) messages received from neighboring neurons
    * _TN_ -
      * electrochemical reaction -
        * electrical w/i neuron; chemical b/w neurons
        * exchange of (+) and (-) ions

---
## AP
* depolarization
  * entry of (+) ions make an AP more likely
* threshold
  * min. intensity needed to fire an AP

    ```
    if intensity > minimum
      AP.fire
    else
      break
    ```

    * AP does not stop until terminal branches
* **"all or none"** response (think binary)
  * gun, thermostat
    * _TN_ -
      * gun - pressure applied exceeds minimum -> fire
      * thermostat - set AC to 76 -> above 76 -> AC turns on

---
## Neuronal Communication
* synapse
  * junction b/w _sending neuron_s + _receiving neuron_s
  * _TN_ -
    * neurons never touch - small gap
    * charge stops (circuit is broken)
      * causes _SN_ in terminal branches release of neurotx into synapse
* neurotransmitters
  * _TN_ -
    * flooding the synapse
      * _SN_ releases too much neurotx
      * cannot bind to dendrites
        * body takes back excess reuptake
  * chems released from _sending neuron_
  * travel across _synapse_
  * bind to receptors of _receiving neuron_s (dendrites)
    * cause AP in _RN_
  * either exciting or inhibiting
* reuptake
  * reabsorbion of excess neurons by the _SN_
  * _TN_ -
    * selective seratonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
      * increases amount of seratonin by preventing reuptake
      * more seratonin -> less depression [sic]

---
## Nervous System
* electrochemical communication system
* 2 parts
  * central nervous system (_CNS_)
  * peripheral nervous system (_PNS_)

---
## Types of Neurons
* Sensory
  * carry incoming info  to _CNS_
  * ex. optic nerve
    * connected on opposite sides at back of brain
* Motor
  * carry outgoing info from _CNS_ to body tissue
  * ex.
    * gross motor and fine motor functions
* interneurons
  * part of _CNS_
  * communicate/intervene b/w **sensory** and **motor**
    * **sensory** does _not_ directly communicate with **motor**, and vice versa
* ex. - catching a ball
  * see the ball
  * move to catch the ball

---
## _CNS_
* spinal cord
  * connects _PNS_ to brain
  * controls reflexes -> instant response to stimuli; much quicker than going to brain and back
    * knee-jerk resp
    * pain reflex
* brain
  * neural networks
    * _def_ - clustered neurons that work together
      * change w/ growth and experience

---
## _PNS_
* connects _CNS_ to rest of body
* 2 components
  * somatic
    * voluntary control of skeletal muscles
  * autonomic
    * control of internal glands/muscles
    * usually operates on its own, but may be consciously overridden
      * somatic component of _PNS_

---
## Autonomic
* dual system
  * differing effects on same structures
  * _TN_ -
    * same organs can be aroused or calmed by sympathetic/parasympathetic
* sympathetic NS
  * arousal
  * mobilizes energy under stress
    * polygraphs
  * fight or flight resp
* parasympathetic NS
  * calming
  * conserves energy

---
## [Remember](#remember)
* NS
  * Central - brain, spinal cord
  * Peripheral
    * autonomic - self-regulated action of organs and glands
      * sympathetic - arousing
      * parasympathetic - calming
    * somatic - voluntary movements of skeletal muscles

---
## Endocrine
* slow communication system
* hormones
  * chemical messengers
  * affect brian and body tissues
* glands
  * synthesize hormones
  * pituitary gland (**Master Gland**)
    * hypothalamus
    * influences growth
    * affects other glands
