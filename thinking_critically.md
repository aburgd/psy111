## Overview
* Types of Psych
  * descriptive studies
    * describes
    * case study, survey, naturalistic observation
  * correlational
    * correlation coefficient, scatterplot
  * experimental
    * IVs and DVs
* Statistics
  * do not have to calculate anything
    * just understand the statistics that are given
  * central tendency; variation

---
## Descriptive - case study
* most simplistic
* attempt to identify universal principles by studying one person in depth
  * _TN_ -
    * learn about widely applied princ.s

* pilot study
  * shorter ver. less in-depth
  * get hypotheses for future studies
  * work out kinks in plans
* suggest hypoth.s, but can be misleading
  * clinical study
  * columbine - 1999
    * _TN_
      * set psych.s down path of what causes people to do these things
      * some info from one does not always apply to others

---
## Descriptive - survey
* _TN_ - attempt to gather info for a pop.n of people by studying a much smaller sample
* assess self-reported data by questioning a representative, random sample
  * population vs sample

---
## Desc. - nat. observ.
* _TN_ -
  * watch and record
  * good way to observe how people interact and behave w/o survey
    * more authentic results
* observing and recording behavior in the nat. env.
  * animals in the wilid
  * educ.l/parenting practices
* _TN_ -
  * analog observ. - bring into office, set up situation to bring about desired behav.

---
## Correlational
* _def_ - extent to which 2 factors vary together and how well either factor predicts the other
  * correlation coefficient
  * scatterplots
  * correlation and causation
* _TN_ -
  *  invest.n to get some idea about exent (")

---
## Correlation Coeff.
* _def_ - a statistical measure of relationship b/w two vars
  * ex. - _r_ = +0.37
    * (+) - pos. rel.
      * _TN_ -
        * shows direction of rel.
          * pos. => change same dir.
          * neg. => change inversely
    * 0.37 - strength of rel. from 0.00 to 1.00
      * or -1.00 to 0.00 if neg.

---
## Scatterplots
* perfect positive => _r_ = +1.00
* perfect negative => _r_ = -1.00
* no rel. => _r_ = 0.00
* _TN_ -
  * pos.    - hours studying _vs._ grade
  * neg.    - days absent _vs._ grade
  * no.rel. - eye color _vs._ grade

---
## Scatterplots (cont.)
* (see [powerpoint] for examples)
* slope (_m_) = **direction** of rel.
  * (+) or (-)
* amount of scatter = **strength** of rel.
  * less => higher correlation
  * _TN_ -
    * how scattered are they
    * closer the data to line --> stronger the rel.
* pos. or neg.?
  * as height inc., weight inc.
    * TV inc., reading dec.
[//]: "" multi.choice q's, no graphing/labeling
---
## Correlation and Causation
* _TN_ -
  * bad thing about _r_ -> don't know which causes which (think chicken _v._ egg)
* examples
  * pos. thinking --> disease cure
  * disease cure --> pos. thinking
  * env./bio. events --> disease cure + pos. thinking

---
## [Remember](#remember)
* Correlation **does not** imply causation
* _TN_ -
  * b/c rel. **cannot** infer that one causes the other

---
## Exp.l Studies
* _TN_ -
  * can talk about cause/effect
    * b/c we are manip. while we keep other var.s under ctrl
* manipulating factos of interest while keeping other factors under ctrl
  * attempts to limit alt. explanation
* experimental cond.ns = **gets** the treatment
* ctrl cond.n = **does not get** the treatmeant
  * _constant_ or _stable_

---
## Exp.l (cont.)
* indep't var (_IV_)
  * factor manipulated by exp'er
* dep't var(_DV_)
  * factor that may change in resp. to indep't var (_outcome_)
  * most often a behavior or mental process
  * **may** change in resp. to $\Delta$ _IV_
    * obsv. behav. or mental proc.
* random assignments
  * _TN_ -
    * some get new treatment (exp.l group)
    * some get placebo - identical to treatment, w/o medicinal val. (ctl. group)
    * _IV_ - pill received
    * _DV_ - behavior, affect on ADHD

---
## Stat.s - meas. of cent. tendency
* _def_ - single score that represents a set of scores
  * _mean_ ($\bar{x}$)- average = sum / n, where n = number of scores
  * _mode_ - most freq. occurring score
  * _median_ - midpt. score = 50th percentile

---
## Example
* (see [powerpoint])

---
## Stat.s (cont.) - meas of variation
* _def_ - measures of simillarity or diversity in a distrib.
  * _range_ - diff. b/w lowest and highest score
  * _stand. dev._ - measure of how much scores vary around the mean
