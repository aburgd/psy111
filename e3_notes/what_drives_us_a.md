## Motivation and Hunger
* motivation
  * instincts
  * drive reduction theory
    * incentives
  * arousal theory
  * Maslow's hierarchy
* hunger
  * physiology
  * eating disorders

---
## Motivation
* _motivation_ - need or desire that energizes and directs behavior

---
## Instincts
* _instinct_ - unlearned, complex behavior w/ fixed pattern throughout species
  * name, but doesn't explain behavior
  * ex. - bird's nest-building behavior

---
## Drive Reduction Theory
* _drive reduction theory_ - physiological need creates and aroused state to be satisfied
  * goal is homeostasis
    * steady internal state
      * ex. - body temperature regulation
* _incentives_ - stimuli that lure/repel

---
## Arousal Theory
* _arousal_ - motivation seeks optimum levels of arousal
  * **driven** to experience stimulation
  * occurs in absence of needs
  * ex. - race car driving

---
## Maslow's Hierarchy
* _Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs_ - some needs should be satisfied before others
* Physical
  * Safety
    * Psychological

---
## Which is which?
* thirst -> drink water == drive reduction
* infant rooting == instinct
* need to drink takes precedence over need to be loved == Maslow
* children exploring environment == arousal

---
## Hunger as Motivation

---
## Physiology of Hunger
* How do we know when we're hungry?
* stomach pangs
  * signal the brain that we are hungry, but
  * hunger persists w/o a stomach
  * so not the whole story...

---
## (cont.)
* glucose
  * as insulin increases, glucose decreases
  * as insulin decreases, glucose increases
* receptors
  * stomach, liver, intestines
* brain
  * hypothalamus

---
## Hypothalamus
* _lateral hypothalamus_ - brings on hunger
  * lesion == no interest in eating
* _ventromedial hypothalamus_ - suppress hunger
  * lesion == excessive eating

---
## Weight Regulation
* _set(tling)-point theory_
  * weight thermostat
  * function of
    * food intake
    * basal metabolic rate

---
## Psychology of Hunger
* eating disorders
  * motive for thinness overwhelms homeostasis
  * thinness is more reinforcing than homeostasis
* examples
  * anorexia nervosa
  * bulimia nervosa

---
## Anorexia Nervosa
* some characteristics
  * refusal to remain normal weight for age/height
  * 15% or more underweight
  * terrified of becoming fat
* ~1% of female adolescents
* sample behaviors
  * food behaviors
  * compulsive exercise

---
## Bulimia Nervosa
* some characteristics
  * diets, becomes hungry, binge-eats
  * purges due to fear of gaining weight
  * may have normal weight
* ~4% of college-aged women
* sample behaviors
  * may gorge in secret
  * buy high-calorie foods
