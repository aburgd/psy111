## The Psychoanalytic Perspective
* Freud
* psychoanalysis
  * unconscious mind
  * personality dev
  * personality struct
  * defense mechanisms
* psychoanalysis today

---
## Personality and Psychoanalysis
* _personality_ - characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting
* _psychoanalysis_ - Freud's personality theory
  * thoughts and actions result from unconscious motives/conflicts

---
## Freud and Structure of the Mind
* three levels of awareness
  * conscious
    * current awareness
  * preconscious
    * outside awareness, still accessible
  * unconscious

---
## Unconscious Mind
* unconscious
  * _TN_ -
    * _Freudian slip_ - misstatements; accidentally said is what you actually mean
      * aka parallel thinking
  * Freud - storehouse for repressed thoughts and feelings
  * today - information processing of which we are unware
* analyzed through
  * free association
  * dreams
    * _TN_ -
      * _manifest content_ - stuff you remember
      * _latent content_ - underlying content uncovered by "specialist"

---
## Freud's Model
(see slide 6)

---
## Personality Dev
(tangent)

---
## Personality Structure
* evolves from conflict between
  * biological impulses
  * social restraints
* 3 personality systems
  * id
  * ego
  * superego

---
## (cont)
* id (unconscious)
  * strives to satisfy sexual and aggressive drives
  * **pleasure principle**
* ego (partly conscious)
  * mediates demands of id and superego
  * **reality principle**
  * personality executive
* superego (conscious)
  * standards for judgement and internalized ideals
  * how one ought to behave

---
## Defense Mechanism
* _defense mechanisms_ - ego's protective methods of reducing anxiety by unconsciously distorting reality
  * repression
  * regression
  * reaction formation
  * projection
  * rationalisation
  * displacement
* **note**: only these six are going to be on the exam

---
## Types of Defense Mechanisms
* _repression_ - banish anxiety-arousing thoughts from consciousness
* _regression_ - retreat to more infantile stage of dev
* _reaction formation_ - ego unconsciously switches unacceptable impulse to their opposites

---
## (cont)
* _projection_ - disguise threatening impulse by attributing them to others
* _rationalisation_ - generate self-justifying explanations to hide real reasons for our actions
* _displacement_ - shift sexual/aggressive impulses to more acceptable object or person

---
## Which is which?
(see slide 13)

---
## Psychoanalysis Today
* some criticisms of Freud may be unfair
  * different methodolgy, technology
* some are valid b/c
  * personality develops throughout life
  * peer influence greatly impacts our life
  * gender identity may develop before 5 or 6y
  * dreams do not represent unfulfilled wishes
  * verbal slips represent cognitive choices

---
## Most Valid Crit
* Psychoanalysis is based on after-the-fact explanations, rather than science-based predications. Thus, the theory cannot be disproved.

---
## Freud's Enduring Contributions
* much of mental life is unconscious
* personality patterns start to form in early childhood
* mental representations guide social interactions
* personality dev invloves more than learning to regulate sexual/aggressive impulses
