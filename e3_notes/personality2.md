## Contemporay Research on Personality
* trait perspective
  * assessing traits
  * Big 5 factors
  * evaluation
* social-cognitive perspective
  * locus of control
  * learned helplessness
  * optimism v. pessimism
  * self-serving bias

---
## Trait Perspective
* _trait perspective_ - personality as a combination of traits
* characteristic behaviors and conscious motives
* assessed by inventory or report
  * honesty
  * impulsivity

---
## Assessing Traits
* empirically derived instruments
  * single-factor assessment
    * investigate one personality trait
      * ex. - anxiety
  * personality inventories
    * assess multiple dimensions simultaneously
      * ex. - MMPI
        * MMPI - most commonly used psych test
          * Minnesota Multi-Facet Personality Inventory

---
## The Big 5 Factors
* approximation of basic trait dimensions
  * mnemonics
* Big 5 --> _"CANOE"_
  * C -> Conscientiousness; careful-careless
  * A -> Agreeableness; trusting-suspicious
  * N -> Neuroticism; calm-anxious
  * O -> Openness; imaginative-practical
  * E -> Extraversion; sociable-retiring

---
## Questioning the Big 5
* how stable?
  * change over dev, stable in adulthood
    * development branch v. stable/master branch
* how heritable?
  * about 50% for each dimension from each parent
* what about other cultures?
  * common across cultures
* do they **predict**?
  * behavior

---
## Evaluating Traits
* person-situation controversy
  * traits may endure, but
  * situational behaviors differ
    * agreeable in all situations?
    * neuroticism in all situations?

---
## Social-Cognitive Perspective
* _social-cognitive perspective_ - personality as interaction of persons and social context
* social
  * conditioning
  * observation
* cognitive
  * what we think about our situations

---
## Locus of Control
* are you **controlled by**, or **controlling of** your environment?
* external - fate is determined by chance or outside forces beyond your control
* internal - one controls one's own fate

---
## Locus of Control Findings
(see slide 10)

---
## Learned Helplessness
* _learned hoplessness_ - hopelessness learned w/ unable to avoid repeated aversive events
  * may perceive control as external
  * studied in environments such as
    * nursing homes
    * prisons
    * work environments
  * Seligman study

---
## Seligman and Maier, 1967
* methods
  * different groups of 8 dogs
    * escape group
    * no-escape group
  * dogs restrained in harness but could move
  * panel to stop electrical shock
    * controlled by escape group
  * retested individually for escape

---
## (cont.)
* results
  * 70% of dogs in no-escape group never escaped shock
  * learned that actions did not change consequences
  * nothing they did previously mattered
    * so they gave up
  * no incentive to escape

---
## Positive Psychology
* _positive psychology_ - study of optimal human functioning
  * promote strengths and virtues that enable individuals to thrive
    * pos emotions
    * pos character
    * pos groups, communities, cultures
  * optimism v. pessimism

---
## Self-Serving Bias
* _self-serving bias_ - a readiness to perceive oneself favorably
* examples
  * take more responsibility for good deeds
  * take more responsibility for successes
  * most see themselves as better than average
  * we remember past actions in self-enhancing ways
  * show inflated confidence in personal beliefs
  * group pride: tendency to view one's group as superior
