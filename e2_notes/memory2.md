## Memory: Storage and Retrieval
* storage (3 steps)
  * sensory memory
    * _iconic_
    * _echoic_
  * working memory
    * aka _short-term_
  * long-term memory
    * emotion and memory
    * explicit vs. implicit memory
* retrieval
  * retrieval cues
* _TN_ -
  * _encode_ => _sensory_ (subtypes) => (rehearsal)=> _working_ OR discard => (rehearsal) => _long-term_ OR discard
      * _short-term_ also helps w/ retrieval

---
## Storage: Sensory Memory
* brief memory after the original stimulus is gone
* does not allow for rehearsal
* 2 types
  * _iconic_ - sensory memory of visual stimuli
    * sperling's experiments
      * _TN_ -
        * first to document length of time that we can retain in visual memory
        * nonsense syllables and asked to recall them
          * then gave line to remember
            * much better recall w/ direction than w/o
    * about .5s long
  * _echoic_ - sensory memory of auditory stimuli
    * about 3 to 4s long

---
## Storage: Working Memory
* active processing of
  * incoming sensory memory info (iconic/echoic)
  * information retrieved from long-term memory
* limited capacity
  * 5 to 9 bits
    * _bit_ - grouping of light information
* limited duration
  * about 20s long
  * as duration increases, recall decreases
* increased capacity through _chunking_

---
## Storage: Long-Term Memory

* _long-term memory_ -
  * relatively permanent and limitless memory store
* estimates of 1000 billions ~ 1000000 billion bits
* includes
  * knowledge
  * skills
  * experience

---
## Emotion and Memory
* heightened emotions == stronger memories
  * stress => more _amygdala_ activity
  * higher arousal => better memory, but
  * prolonged stress => memory disruption
    * _TN_ -
      * cortisol can damage ability to retrieve info from memory

---
## Explicit v. Implicit Memory
* _explicit_ (_declarative_)
  * memory of facts and experiences
  * consciously known and declared
  * processed in hippocampus
  * anterograde amnesia
  * ex.
    * facts
    * events
* _implicit_ (_procedural_)
  * memory of skill, actions, and conditioning effects
  * retention independent of conscious recollection
  * process in cerebellum
  * ex.
    * motor/cognitive skills
    * classical conditioning

---
## Retrieval
* _retrieval_ - getting info out of memory (long- or short-term)
* measures of memory
  * _recognition_: identify items previously learned
  * _recall_: retrieve info learned earlier using effort
  * _relearning_: shows the amoun of time saved w/ learning something for a second time

---
## Retrieval Cues
* memories are stored through related associations
* accessed via _retrieval cues_
  * associations that help you retrieve memories
  * best associations are formed w/ memory is encoded
* _priming_ -
  * activation of associations in memory

---
## Stored Memory
(see slide 10)

---
## Retrieval Cues
* _context effects_
  * context where you experience something == better memory retrieval
  * ex.
    * going back to old school, neighborhood, etc

---
## Another Context Effects
* _deja vu_
  * sense that you have experienced something before
  * related to cues from the current situation
  * most commonly
    * sense of recollection is strong, but
    * circumstances of the "previous" experience are uncertain

---
## Memory and Mood
* _mood-congruent memories_
  * tendency to recall experiences consistent w/ current good or bad mood
  * when sad == **everything** is bad
  * when happy == **everything** is good
