---
## A quick review
* remember associative learning
* classical conditioning
  * associations b/w events the organism does _not_ control
  * respondent behavior
* **different from**

---
## Operant conditioning
* operant conditioning
  * behavior **then** reinforcer == strengthened
  * behavior **then** punisher == weakened
* operant behavior
  * behavior operates on the environment and **PRODUCES** responses

---
## Skinner and Behaviorism
* _E.L. Thorndike's law of effect_
  * _TN_ -
    * studied cats
  * rewarded behavior is likely to recur
* shaping
  * build on existing behaviors
  * reinforce _successive approximations_ of desired behavior
  * first step cannot be too **big**

---
## Examples of shaping
* overcoming fears
* learning to write
* learning to swim
* animal training
  * (see SeaWorld)

---
## Reinforcement
* What is it?
  * event that _strengthens_ the behavior it follows
* 2 types
  * pos. reinf.
  * neg. reinf.

---
## Pos. v. Neg. Reinf.
* _TN_ -
  * "increases" ==> reinforcement
* pos. reinf.
  * _addition_ of desirable consequence _increases_ behavior
* neg. reinf.
  * _removal_ of an aversive consequence _increases_ behavior
  * **not punishment**

---
## Pos. or Neg.?
(see slide 8)
* a raise for job well-done
  * pos
* candy for doing good in school
  * pos
* using umbrella to get out of rain
  * neg
* aspirin for headache
  * neg
* pressing snooze
  * neg

---
## Punishment
* what is it?
  * event that _decreases_ the behavior it follows
  * opposite effect of reinf.
* 2 types
  * pos. punishment
    * _TN_ -
      * TK
  * neg. punishment

---
## Pos. v. Neg. Punishment
* _TN_ -
  * "decreases" ==> punishment
* pos. punishment
  * _addition_ of an aversive consequence _decreases_ behavior
* neg. punishment
  * _removal_ of desirable consequence _decreases_ behavior

---
## [Remember](#remember)
For both reinforcement and punishment, the words _positive_ and _negative_ refer only to the _addition_ or _removal_ of a consequence, not the effects on behavior.

---
## Pos. or Neg.?
(see slide 12)

---
## Potential side effects of punishment
* spanking:
  * may lead to unwanted fears
  * gives no information about what to do
  * unwanted behaviors reappear in its absence
  * may lead to aggression against the agent
  * one unwanted behavior replaces another

---
## Schedules of reinforcement
* continuous
  * reinforcing _every_ instance of behavior
  * best for teaching new skills
  * ex: housebreaking a pet
* partial (intermittent)
  * reinforcing _some_ instances of behavior
  * best for maintaining established behaviors
  * ex: occasionally giving in to tantrums

---
## Partial reinf. (ratio schedules)
* fixed-ratio
  * reinforce after _specific number_ of responses
  * ex: sticker after every 4 assignments turned in
* variable-ratio
  * reinforce after _unpredictable number_ of responses
  * ex: slot machines

---
## Partial reinf. (interval schedules)
* fixed-interval
  * reinforce after _specific period of time_
  * ex: praise after 5 minutes of on-task behavior
* variable-interval
  * reinforce after _unpredictable period of time_
  * ex: fishing

---
## Operant conditioning is everywhere
* school
  * classroom behavioral mgmt
* work
  * bonuses for good work; fired for bad work
* home
  * parent-training programs
* sports
  * relationship b/w performance and playing time
