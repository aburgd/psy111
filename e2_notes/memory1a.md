## Memory
* encoding
  * getting info into memory
* encoding - how?
  * automatic processing
  * effortful processing
* encoding - what?
  * meaning
  * image
  * organization

---
## Encoding - How?
* _automatic processing_
  * unconscious encoding of incidental (unimportant) information
    * _TN_ -
      * brain decides what needs to be kept (more time spent on it) and what need to be tossed (in one ear out the other)
  * examples
    * space
      * spatial relationships - where something is located in a book, not the page or the content, just where it is
    * time
      * time-based relationship - finding something lost by retracing steps
    * frequency
        * things that are repeated are often remembered better
  * encoded information may become automatic after
    * effortful procesesing

---
## (cont.)
* _effortful processing_
  * requires attention and conscious effort
  * leads to durable and accessible memories
    * _TN_ -
      * longer-lasting memory
  * enhance through _rehearsal_
    * repition of info to maintain in consciousness or encode for storage
  * consider
    * Herman Ebbinghaus
      * _TN_ -
        * first to study effortful processing
        * nonsense syllables from Day 1 and Day 2 he remembered better than 3 and 4

---
## An Example
* Twelve Days of Christmas illustration
  * first day - partridge in a pear tree +
  * second day - two turtle doves +
  * third - three french hens +
  * fourth - _calling birds_ -
  * fifth - five golden rings +
  * sixth - _geese a-laying_ -
  * seventh - _seven swans a-swimming_ -
  * eight = _maids a-milking_ -
  * nine - _ladies dancing_ -
  * ten - _lords a-leaping_ -
  * eleven - _pipers piping_ -
  * twelve - _drummers drumming_ -

## Answers
(see slide 6)

---
## Memory Effects
* _spacing effect_
  * distrib.'d practice is better than massed study for long-term retention
  * longer space b/w practice == better retention
  * ex - studying over time v. cramming night before
* _serial position effect_
  * tendency to recal first and last items in list
  * recency effect
  * primacy effect
  * ex - name recal

---
## [Remember](#remember)
* _Amount remembered depends on time spent learning_

---
## Encoding - What?
* encoding the meaning
  * _semantic encoding_
  * meaningful context aids in encoding
  * rephrasing what we hear into meaningful terms
  * ex - self-reference effect

---
## (cont.)
* _visual encoding_
  * encode visual images more easily
  * remember concrete words better than abstract
* _mnemonic devices_
  * memory aids that use vivid imagery and organization
  * method of loci
  * _TN_ -
    * location - encoding things w/ picture

---
## Mnemonic Devices - What do these mean?
(see slide 11)

---
## Memory is enhanced through
* meaning
* imagery
* organization

---
## Encoding - What? (cont.)
* organization and encoding
  * chunking
    * organizing items into familiar, manageable units
    * chunking numbers for recall
    * acronyms
  * hierarchies
    * complex info broken down into broad concepts and further subdivided

---
## Hierarchy Example
(see slide 14)
