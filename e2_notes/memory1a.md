## Memory
* encoding
  * getting info into memory
* encoding - how?
  * automatic processing
  * effortful processing
* encoding - what?
  * meaning
  * image
  * organization

---
## Encoding - How?
* automatic processing
  * unconscious encoding of incidental information
  * examples
    * space
    * time
    * frequency
  * encoded information may become automatic after

---
## (cont.)
* effortful processing
  * requires attention and conscious effort
  * leads to durable and accessible memories
  * enhance through _rehearsal_
    * repition of info to maintain in consciousness or encode for storage
  * consider
    * Herman Ebbinghaus

---
## An Example
* _TN_ -
  * TK

---
## Answers
(see slide 6)

---
## Memory Effects
* _spacing effect_
  * distrib.'d practice is better than massed study for long-term retention
  * longer space b/w practice == better retention
  * ex - studying over time v. cramming night before
* serial position effect
  * tendency to recal first and last items in list
  * recency effect
  * primacy effect
  * ex - name recal

---
## [Remember](#remember)
* _Amount remembered depends on time spent learning_

---
## Encoding - What?
* encoding the meaning
  * _semantic encoding_
  * meaningful context aids in encoding
  * rephrasing what we hear into meaningful terms
  * ex - self-reference effect

---
## (cont.)
* _visual encoding_
  * encode visual images more easily
  * remember concrete words better than abstract
* _mnemonic devices_
  * memory aids that use vivid imagery and organization
  * method of loci
  * _TN_ -
    * TK

---
## Mnemonic Devices - What do these mean?
(see slide 11)

---
## Memory is enhanced through
* meaning
* imagery
* organization

---
## Encoding - What? (cont.)
* organization and encoding
  * chunking
    * organizing items into familiar, manageable units
    * chunking numbers for recall
    * acronyms
  * hierarchies
    * complex info broken down into broad concepts and further subdivided

---
## Hierarchy Example
(see slide 14)
