## Learning
* how do we learn?
* early behaviorism
* classical conditionsing
  * Pavlov's work
  * 5 major conditioning processes
* examples of classical conditioning
  * taste aversion
  * watson and little albert

---
## How do we learn?
* learning
  * (_book def_)relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience
* How?
  * by association
  * stimulus-stimulus learning (classical)
  * response-consequence (operant)
    * _TN_ -
      * behavior with consequence -> change

---
## Classical or Operant
(see slide 4-5)

---
## Early Behaviorism
* _TN_ -
  * two diff schools of psych
    * psychoanalysis (Freud)
    * behaviorists (Skinner)
      * everything Freud talked about was useless
      * thoughts/feelings don't mean anything
      * we should study what we can _see/observe_
* mental concepts are useless
  * introspection
  * consciousness
  * thoughts/feelings
* **Psychology == observable behavior**
* all animals learn in the same way

---
## Classical Conditioning
* Ivan Pavlov
  * not a psychologist by vocation
    * physiologist
  * physiology of salivation
  * _observed_ of salivation
  * Would dogs salivate upon presentation of a neutral stimulus, if the stimulus is paired w/ food?
    * **yes**

---
## Classical Conditioning (cont.)
* before conditioning (learning)
  * naturally happened
  * food == salivation
  * tone != produce salivation
* during conditioning
  * pairing of tone + food == salivation
* after conditioning
  * tone == salivation

---
## [Classical Conditioning Terms](#remember1)
* Unconditioned stimulus (_US_)
  * naturally triggers a response
* Unconditioned response (_UR_)
  * naturally occuring response to _US_
* Conditioned stimulus (_CS_)
  * neutral stimulus that comes to trigger _CR_
* Conditioned response (_CR_)
  * learned response to previously neutral _CS_

---
## Classical Conditioning Diagram
(see slide 10)

---
## [Major Conditioning Process](#remember2)
* _acquisition_
  * initial learning of stim/resp relationship
  * consider timing
  * may be biologically important
  * _CS_ **signals** the _US_ is coming
    * _tone_ **signals** _food_
    * _lightning_ **signals** _thunder_

---
## [(cont.)](#remember3)
* _extinction_
  * decrease of a _CR_ when...
  * a _US_ **does not** follow a _CS_
    * repeated tone **w/o** food
* _spontaneous recovery_
  * reappearance of weakened _CR_
  * **following** a pause

---
## Extinction and Spontaneous Recovery
(see slide 13)

---
## [MCP (cont.)](#remember4)
* generalization
  * respond to stimuli _similar_ to _CS_
  * lion and tiger == increased heart rate
  * (Pavlov) = similar sounding tones
* discrimination
  * distinguis b/w _CS_ and other stimuli
  * lion and house cat != increased heart rate
  * (Pavlov) == tone and voice

---
## Classical Conditioning Examples
* taste aversion
  * food w/ characteristic of another food == sickness
  * one-trial learning
  * consider timing
    * does not have to occur quickly

---
## (cont.)
* Watson and Little Albert
  * conditioned fear of a white rat
  * loud noise while playing w/ rat
  * crying + fear of rate
  * fear generalized to other furry things
    * rabbit beard, Santa Claus
  * unethical!
