[powerpoint]: (/slides/Learning3.pptx)

---
## Learning by observation
* observational learning
  * observe and imitate others
  * modeling
  * **no experience necessary**
* differs from
  * classical conditioning
  * operant conditioning

---
## Observational Learning
* importance of social behaviors
* memes
  * transmitted cultural elements
    * ideas
    * fashions
    * habits

---
## Back to Biology
* _mirror neurons_
  * show increased activity when watching people
    * same activity while doing it
  * neural basis for observational learning
  * frontal lobe
  * fire w/ performing actions or observing others doing so
    * language
    * empathy

---
## Is aggression learned?
* why are people aggressive?
  * _TN_ -
    * physical aggression (more likely males)
    * relational/emotional aggression (more likely females)
  * biologically based
  * situational factors
    * repeated frustration
      * _TN_ -
        * not the first time x has happened
        * builds up
  * learned behavior

---
## Bandura and BoBo...
* adult model on child aggression
* procedure
  * child/experimenter together
    * aggressive/nonaggressive model
    * model of same/different gender
  * arousal of anger or frustration
    * toys "for the other children"
  * test for imitation
    * other toys, including BoBo

---
## B and B (cont.)
* results
  * exposure led to imitation of violence
    * specific motor and verbal behaviors
  * gender of model was important
    * _TN_ -
      * boys paired with men in A acted more akin to men, than those paired with women
    * boys modeled men
* importance
  * learning w/o reinforcement
  * aggression is permissible

---
## Observational Learning IRL
* good
  * prosocial models
  * clinical applications
    * overcoming phobias
    * increasing pos. behavior
* bad
  * antisocial models => antisocial effects
    * Little League parents
      * _TN_ -
        * yell at umpires, kids, etc.
        * does not help performance
        * embarrasses
        * if that's your model
          * you kids will do the same thing you do

## And then there's...
(see slide 9)

---
## TV: Some statistics
* in America
  * 9/10 teens watch TV daily
  * 2/3 of homes have 3 or more TVs
  * average child views 8000 TV murders before finishing elementary school
  * if you live to 75, you will spend ~9y watching TV

---
## Effects of TV
* media violence and aggression
  * not all who watch become aggressive
  * not the only factor, but it is important
  * repeated exposure desensitizes
  * cumulative effects can be severe
