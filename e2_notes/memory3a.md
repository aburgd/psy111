## Forgetting, Memory Construction, and Improvement
* forgetting
  * encoding failure
  * storage decay
  * retrieval failure
* memory construction
  * misinformation and imagination
    * Loftus et al.
  * repressed or constructed?
* tips for memory improvement

---
## Encoding Failure
* encoding failure
  * can't remember what isn't encoded
  * info does not enter long-term

---
## EF Example
(see slide 4)

---
## Storage Decay
* memory traces fade w/ time
* forgetting curve

---
## Retrieval Failure
* can't access stored info
* two forms of interference
  * _proactive_ - previous learning disrupts recall of new info
    * ex. going to where you parked yesterday
  * _retroactive_ - new learning disrupts recall of previous info
    * ex. learning new names disrupts recall of previous names

---
## Forgetting is due to
* encoding failure
  * never acquire
* storage decay
  * discarded
* retrieval failure
  * can't be accessed

---
## Repressed Memories
* Freudian defense mechanism
  * anxiety-arousing memories forcibly blocked from consciousness
  * motivated forgetting
* but do they exist?

---
## Memory Construction
* misinformation effect
  * incorporate misleading info into memory
  * fill in memory gaps w/ guess and assumptions
  * misinformation == misremembering
* misinfo ex.

---
## Loftus et al. and Misinformation
* eyewitness memory reconstruction

---
## (cont.)
* Group A
  * how fast were the cars going when they **hit** each other?
* Group B
  * how fast were the cars going when they **smashed** into each other
* 1 week later
  * was there any broken glass?

---
## Repressed or Constructed?
* child abuse is real, but
  * so are false accusations based on memory
* clinicians and memory "recovery"
  * memory work --> vivid recollections
* so, do repressed memories exist?

---
## Professional Societies Agree
* sexual abuse happens
* recovered memories happen, but
* memories "recovered" under hypnosis or drugs are **unreliable**
* memories before age 3 are **unreliable**

Most traumatic experiences are remembered vividly, not repressed.

## So how can understanding memory help you?

---
## Tips for Memory Improvement
* study repeatedly
* spend time rehearsing and actively thinking
* make the material personally meaningful
* use mnemonic devices
* use retrieval cues
* recall events while they are fresh
* minimize interference
* test yourself
